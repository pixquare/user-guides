## Advanced mode
![Advanced mode](images/advanced_mode.png)<br/>
Pixquare doesn't want to overwhelm beginners right at the beginning, so a few features can be hidden by turning off Advanced Mode.\nIf you're feeling that Pixquare has too many options that you don't know to use and want to learn the basics first, you can turn this off. Once you're comfortable with the app, you can come back and re-endable Advanced Mode.
