# File/folder options

## How to show the options
![Entry options](images/entry_options.png)
Each entry in the browser has a few actions that you can use to manipulate the files and folders.<br/>
To reveal those options, long press on the file/folder or swipe right.<br/>

## Files/folder options
The options to manipulate files and folders are:
- ![Rename](images/rename.png): Rename
- ![Copy](images/copy.png): Copy
- ![Cut](images/cut.png): Cut
- ![Delete](images/delete.png): Delete
- ![Export](images/export.png): Export. If the selected entry is a folder, it will export all the artworks inside that folder and compress them into a zip file. For more info, check out [Export](../../Export/export.md)
- ![Share](images/share.png): Share. Use this option to quickly share the `.px` file, such as via email, air-drop, etc.

## File/folder copy/cut
When there are file/folder being copied/cut, the `Paste` button will appear at the bottom right of the browser window. After navigating to the destination location, you can hit that button to paste.

## `Files` app compatability
**Note**: Pixquare's file system is also exposed in `Files` app. You can also manage your files there as well. However, if the names include special characters, please do not rename them in `Files` as Pixquare does apply URL percent encoding, so those entries with special characters will not be operatable in Pixquare.
