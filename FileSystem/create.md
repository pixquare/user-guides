# Create
When you're at the file browser, you can create folder and artwork. As for artwork, you can either create a new blank artwork or import.

## Create Folder
To create a folder, tap on the add button ![add](./images/add.png), then `Folder`. A textfield will appear and you will be able to enter the name of the new folder. Hit `OK` to create the folder. If there is another folder with the same name, the operation will fail.

## Create artwork
To create a new blank artwork, tap on the add button ![add](./images/add.png), then `Artwork`. A new window will show up. Here you can do the followings:
- Enter the name of the new artwork
- Enter the width and height of the artwork. The maximum dimensions are 1500 x 1500.

## Import an artwork
Pixquare support importing `.px`, `.aseprite` or `.ase` (only RGB color space, grayscale and indexed are not supported yet), and images files (up to 1500 x 1500). You can import by tapping on the add button ![add](./images/add.png), then `Import`, select either `Photos` or `Files` for the source. Navigate to the file location and select it.
